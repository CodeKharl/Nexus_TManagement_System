## 🛠️ Build Instructions

Make sure you have **Java (JDK)** and **Bash** installed.

Run the build script from the project root:

```bash
./scripts/build

Build Output

    build/ → Compiled .class files

    bin/ → Executable JAR file

▶️ Running the Application

After building, run the generated JAR file:

java -jar bin/<jar-file-name>.jar

Replace <jar-file-name> with the actual name of the JAR file inside the bin directory.
🧾 Manifest Configuration

    The manifest file is located in meta-inf/

    You may modify it based on the contents and entry point of the src directory

    Ensure the Main-Class matches your main Java class

🚀 Getting Started (Clone & Build)

git clone <repository-url>
cd Nexus_TManagement_System
./scripts/build

📌 Notes

    This project uses static visualization, not real-time graphs

    Designed to be minimal and beginner-friendly

    Suitable for academic projects or Java practice
